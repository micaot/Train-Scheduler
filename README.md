## Requirements
#### Create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
- Train Name
- Destination
- First Train Time -- in military time
- Frequency -- in minutes
- The app should be able to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
- Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

## Technologies Used
- Jquery
- AJAX 
- Firebase
- HTML
- CSS
- Moment.js
